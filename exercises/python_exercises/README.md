##### **Exercise 1**

We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?

Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.

##### **Exercise 2**

Complete the solution so that it reverses all of the words within the string passed in.

Example:

`reverseWords("The greatest victory is that which requires no battle")
// should return "battle no requires which that is victory greatest The"`

##### **Exercise 3**

You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1.

As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero.

For example, if n = 10:

`return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`

##### **Exercise 4**

You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.

##### **Exercise 5**

Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

For example:

`summation(2) -> 3
1 + 2
summation(8) -> 36
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8`

##### **Exercise 6**

Simple, remove the spaces from the string, then return the resultant string.

##### **Exercise 7**

Create a function that takes in a list and returns a list with the reverse order.

Examples
`reverse_list([1,2,3,4]) == [4,3,2,1]
reverse_list([3,1,5,4]) == [4,5,1,3]`

##### **Exercise 8**

Define a function that removes duplicates from an array of numbers and returns it as a result.

The order of the sequence has to stay the same.

##### **Exercise 9**

You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.

Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.

For example, update_light('green') should return 'yellow'.

##### **Exercise 10**

The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100, The second - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc.

Task :
Given a year, return the century it is in.

Input , Output Examples ::
`centuryFromYear(1705)  returns (18)
centuryFromYear(1900)  returns (19)
centuryFromYear(1601)  returns (17)
centuryFromYear(2000)  returns (20)`
